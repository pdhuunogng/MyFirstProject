Machine language instruction
- consists of
    + operation code:
    + address fields: 
Instruction set design
- two different appraoches:
    + reduced instruction set comp (RISC)
    + complex instruction set com (CISC)
Typical machine instruction
- notation
- data transfer instruction
- branch
    + JUMP X - unconditional
